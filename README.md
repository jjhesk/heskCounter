heskCounter
===========
This is the JQ numeric counter for display a list of digits.
It is a part of my project for Fansliving (still undergo heavy development) and I will tell you the url later.
You can see there is a counter on www.badoo.com and thats pretty cool too. So I used the first 20 mins to develop a plugin where it can work for the requirement on Fansliving project.
This is just the code part from the hold project but it still requires a set number of picture and the source will be displayed in the folder.
Feel free to fork and add your favorit extensions and I would love to see your integrations.

Coding is art!

Cheers
